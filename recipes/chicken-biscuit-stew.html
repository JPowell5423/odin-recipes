    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken biscuit stew is a good recipe to use rotisserie chicken. Itâ€™s so simple to make, one pot, easy cleanup, and tastes like homemade potpie.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (10.5) ounce can chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package frozen vegetables</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk continuously to make a roux, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Gradually add broth and milk whisking until thick, smooth, and bubbly, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken, frozen vegetables, and onion. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. 
            Place biscuits on top of the chicken mixture, lightly pressing each down.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Check at about 15 minutes, and if biscuits are browning too quickly, cover with a piece of foil. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
